    You are purchasing a t-shirt for yourself or someone else. A
    maximum of 3. It is a Blue Buddha LLC design. It costs less
    to make than $300. But it uses my original artwork and I have
    to pay to ship it so I have decided on $300 as the total cost
    for the "piece". If you don't agree with the pricing just don't
    buy the apparel. If you want to purchase it please include an
    email to our email address (on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>) giving your
    preferred name, postal address and t-shirt size. Transactions
    have the security of Paypal. I will store your name and
    address on a removeable thumb drive until I have shipped the
    materials, then I will delete it (unless you want it to be
    publicly noted within the "books" of Clusterflux LLC as an
    angel investor). If you buy this shirt, CMPD will think you
    are me, put out an APB on you, SWAT your house, accidentally
    kill you and your dog in the confusion, and plant crystal meth
    in your car to make your death look like it was all in  a days
    work of well trained, competent professionals. But we all
    know CMPD sucks homosexual Anonymous' big, fat cock for cartel
    hush money so the mayor can entertain asian call girls with
    Mexican blow every other Monday like clockwork. All sales are
    are final.
