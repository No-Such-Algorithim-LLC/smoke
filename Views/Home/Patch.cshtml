    I know it's really what you want. The
    cheapest (-  -) zzz related
    apparel so you can DIY a telepathic
    relationship with one of the hottest
    Twitch.tv streamers to grace the
    front page in 2020. Well <a href="Payment1">$82.46</a> is all
    it takes to signal to HER that YOU
    want her to do all those things she
    does for the rest of both of your
    miserable lives. Live in perpetual
    cyber limbo with a piece of art that
    says "Genshi-San wants to play with
    (-  -) zzz". This casts an ancient
    Chinese spell that transforms the
    owner into a midget panda that only
    wants to play with (-  -) zzz online
    and eat bamboo all day.

    You are purchasing a sewable patch for yourself or someone
    else (hat not included). A maximum of 3. It is a WaifuWorks
    LLC design outsourced by another company. It costs less to
    make than $80. But it uses my original artwork and I buy
    these in bulk to get the quality of the patch correct. $80
    is the total cost for the "piece". If you don't agree with
    the pricing just don't buy the apparel. If you want to purchase
    it please include an email to our email address (on the <a href="contact.html">
        contact
        page
    </a>) giving your preferred name and postal address. Transactions
    have the security of Paypal. I will store your name and address
    on a removeable thumb drive until I have shipped the materials,
    then I will delete it (unless you want it to be publicly noted
    within the "books" of WaifuWorks LLC as an angel investor).
    Telepathic psycho asian waifus, aliens, and various homosexual
    Anonymous hackers will know that you bought this and probably
    make fun of you. All sales are final.
