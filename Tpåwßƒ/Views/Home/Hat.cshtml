    You are purchasing a hat for yourself or someone else. A
    maximum of 3. It is a WaifuWorks LLC design outsourced by
    another company. It costs less to make than $80. But it uses
    my original artwork and I have to spend an hour of labor sewing
    the patch onto a hat (fairly tedious work, and I hate tedious work).
    $80 is the total cost for the "piece". If you don't agree with
    the pricing just don't buy the apparel. If you want to purchase
    it please include an email to our email address (on the <a href="contact.html">
        contact
        page
    </a>) giving your preferred name, postal address, and at least 3
    prefered colors. Transactions have the security of Paypal. I will
    store your name and address on a removeable thumb drive until I
    have shipped the materials, then I will delete it (unless you want
    it to be publicly noted within the "books" of WaifuWorks LLC as an
    angel investor). Telepathic psycho asian waifus, aliens, and various
    homosexual Anonymous hackers will know that you bought this and
    probably make fun of you. All sales are final.
