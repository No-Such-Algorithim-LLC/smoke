    You are purchasing the publishing rights to 75 pieces and the
    story arcs to the entire VR experience published online so far.
    It is a WaifuWorks LLC design. It uses my original artwork and
    short stories. If you don't agree with the pricing just don't
    buy the art. If you want to purchase it please include an email
    to our email address (on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>) giving your preferred

    name, and any special requests you may have before purchasing. I
    will store your name and email address on a removeable thumb
    drive until I have delivered the materials, then I will delete
    it (unless you want it to be publicly noted within the "books"
    of WaifuWorks LLC as an  angel investor). Telepathic psycho
    asian waifus, aliens, and various homosexual Anonymous hackers
    will know that you bought this and probably make fun of you.
    All sales are final.
